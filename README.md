# ERPSystem
Made a simple ERP system for a factory in my summer vacations last year. 
I used Java to code and Android Studio IDE to build the app. The database management was done using Firebase real-time database.

You can have a look at it's working here:

# To run the project
- Clone this project and open in Android Studio
- Make an account in Firebase and add your services.json
- Build the app and enjoy!

# TODO
- Currently the app is in it's basic functional state. A lof work has to be done on the UI/UX of the app.
